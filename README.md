# Pizza Project

An application where you can explore a list of pizzas, add items, adjust quantities, remove products, and view the total cart calculation. Navigation between pages is handled with React Router, and the state is managed with Redux.

I would like to especially thank my **Jonas Schmedtmann** for their constant motivation and guidance throughout the development of this project. Their support helped me overcome challenges and progress in my learning.
